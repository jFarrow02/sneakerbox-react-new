_For athletic shoe enthusiasts everywhere._

Sneakerbox is an e-commerce front-end web application for a fictional athletic shoe company. Sneakerbox is a React application that is created as a companion application to _sneakerbox_, a NodeJS/ExpressJS api server.

Sneakerbox uses functional components wherever possible for human readability and better minification, as well as
to make use of React hooks [https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
